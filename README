HW4 Scaffolding for CS 120, Fall 2015

This scaffolding should serve as a starting point for your homework project.
It contains a Makefile which should build things (you probably won't need to
modify it, but you can if you want to), this README, and all required source
code files.

hw4.c and wordsearch.c both contain only stubs and comments; it is your job
to write the code in these files.  wordsearch.h contains headers for the
functions in wordsearch.c, and wordsearchTests.c contains a suite of unit tests
for the functions in wordsearch.c.  You should probably not need to change
these files much, if at all.  If you want to add extra functions you can, but
you shouldn't remove or alter any of the ones that are there in the
scaffolding.

The project should compile as-is, but it won't do anything since all the
functions are just stubs.  The tests should compile and run without crashing,
though most of them will fail to pass (again, the functions are stubs, though a
few tests may get "passed" by the default return values in the stubs).

Be sure you replace this README with one of your own, and add your name(s) into
the comments at the top of each source file, before you turn in your
submission (don't delete my name, though; you want the names of *all* the authors
who worked on a given file to appear at the top of the file, along with the last
date each author worked on it.
